##  Problem Statement

Harassment via phone calls and text messages is a growing issue. Current tools like True caller and telecom spam filters rely on user reports and fail to analyze actual conversation content, leaving many users vulnerable to *verbal abuse, **scam threats, and **blackmail*.

*Guardian AI* is an AI-powered system designed to proactively detect and alert users to harassment — both in calls and messages — using advanced speech recognition and NLP models.

##  Our Approach

###  Call Harassment Detection:
1. Record calls from unknown numbers (user opt-in).
2. Convert speech to text using *Google Speech-to-Text* or *OpenAI Whisper*.
3. Analyze using fine-tuned *NLP models* (BERT/GPT) to detect abusive content.
4. Notify user and offer options: *Block, **Report, **Save as Evidence*.

###  Message Harassment Detection:
1. Real-time scanning of incoming messages.
2. NLP-based classification (safe / suspicious / harassing).
3. User actions: *Block Sender, **Auto-Warn, or **Store Evidence*.
